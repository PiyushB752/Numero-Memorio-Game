## Numero-Memorio-Game ##

Hi, I'm Piyush Bachani from Kalvium x RVU Squad 49. I've created a game for my game development CA-2, and it's called Numero Memorio.
This game is developed using various technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed to be played on both desktops and 
mobile devices.




Here are my Figma designs for this game which gives a clear ideas for its design and working:

Desktop version - https://www.figma.com/file/30Lsg0M79qcOsbs82AIBfM/Game-Development?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=m1UjmDCtHdkLUxuR-1

Mobile version - https://www.figma.com/file/fMrQwZ0kV8KPTN5sCdgR8A/Game-Development(mobile)?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=MXOntySOuqnACaVE-1



Here is how the game works:-

In this game, the user has to enter their Name and Nickname which needs to be displayed in the game. Then the user has to choose a
difficulty. There are 5 different difficulty i.e.  Beginners , Easy , Medium , Hard and Very Hard. After choosing a difficulty , the
user is directed towards the difficulty selected. In that difficulty level , there would a time runnning  and a random number would 
be displayed. If the timer reaches to 0 seconds , the random number becomes 0 and an input box is generated where the user has to 
enter the generated random number and click on submit. On clicking the sumbit button , if the generated random number is equal to 
number entered by user , the above score board increases and next random number generates. Or else , the user would be directed to
the final score board which displays the total score and option to wheather to play again or change the current difficulty level.
